I forget what the challenge's title was, but I remember the file name. Hence MathCheck.

Essentially you're given a C file that takes in an input string (in the form of a character array) and rearranges the characters. You're given the scrambled flag and you have to figure out what to increment the index by in order to unscramble it.

I pretty much just tried all the values from 1-6, and when I tried 7 I saw the letters "F L A G" with other chars in the spaces. I doubled the increment to 14 and the flag was revealed. Modular magic.
